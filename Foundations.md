# Foundations

## What is user experience

UX is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product. A **product** can be a *good*, a *service*, or a *feature*.

For a user to have a good experience, a product must be usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.

Usability refers to clear and intuitive design e.g., icons have very obvious meanings or they have text with them.

Equitable design means a product that is accessible to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. It ensures a high-quality experience is delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability. It improves the user's quality of life. As you evaluate the equity of a product’s UX, you can ask questions like: Are the needs of a diverse group of users considered? Does the product’s design address the needs of traditionally underrepresented and excluded groups? 

Enjoyable products create a connection between the user and the product. This involves research.

Useful, means a product that solves a problem for the user.

## Product Development Life Cycle

- Brainstorm
- Define
- Design
- Test
- Launch
The course content focuses on the product development lifecycle in UX design, outlining the stages involved in transforming an idea into a tangible product.

Brainstorm Stage
- This initial stage emphasizes generating ideas and understanding user needs and challenges.
- Research is crucial, involving methods like user interviews to gather insights.

Define Stage
- The team narrows down the focus based on insights from brainstorming, determining how the product will impact users.
- Specific details about the product's purpose, target audience, and necessary features are established.

Design Stage
- UX designers actively develop ideas and ensure that specifications from the define stage are realistic.
- Various design assets, such as storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes, are created to visualize the user experience.

Test Stage
- The product design is evaluated through user feedback, identifying areas for improvement.
- Collaboration between UX designers and engineers is essential to refine the design and ensure functionality.

Launch Stage
- The final stage involves sharing the product with the public, such as launching an app or website.
- Post-launch, there may still be opportunities for enhancements based on user feedback. 

Overall, the five stages are brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch, each playing a critical role in creating a successful user experience.

## UX Design Roles

User research: User research is about understanding the people who use your product. Through research, you’ll learn about users’ backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and goals. Your research methods might include surveys, observations, and interviews. We’ll explore user research in much more detail in an upcoming course. 

Information architecture: Information architecture, or IA for short, involves deciding how your product is organized and structured. Think of IA as a skeleton that outlines how users interact with your product. Everything in your product should be organized in ways that make sense to the user and meets their expectations.

Wireframing: A wireframe is a basic outline or sketch of a product or a screen, like an app or website. As the name suggests, wireframes look like they were created with wires. They’re mostly lines and shapes, with some text. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally using software. Wireframing helps you bring your design ideas to life, so other people on your team can provide input and feedback. 

Prototyping: A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality. Prototypes can be in physical or digital formats and can vary in complexity. Sometimes a prototype is made to demonstrate one specific feature of a product, like the transition between screens or the way the product physically looks and feels. You’ll make multiple prototypes for any given product throughout the design process.

Visual design: Visual design focuses on how the product or technology looks. As a UX designer, you need to understand the foundations of visual design in order to communicate the connection between a product’s functionality and its appearance to users. You’ll learn some of the most important principles of visual design throughout this certificate program. 

Effective communication: Effective communication as a UX designer means connecting with your colleagues through emails, meetings, presentations, and design software. UX design is a very collaborative field, so being able to communicate both digitally and face-to-face with teammates is important. You need to be a good listener, be receptive to feedback, and share your ideas in a clear way.

## Universal design, inclusive design, and equity-focused design

Universal design is the process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations. Think of it like a one-size-fits-all approach. Designers propose one solution for everyone. 

Inclusive design includes researchers and designers from traditionally excluded populations in the process, so they can provide their unique perspectives during all phases of the design process. If universal design is a one size fits all solution, then inclusive design can be described as solve for one, extend to many.  With inclusive design, you solve for one type of user and the benefit of that solution can extend to many other types of users. Designing products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities is called **accessibility**.

Equity-focused design takes the idea of inclusive design one step further. It asks designers to focus on designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products. The goal of equity-focused design is to uplift groups that have been excluded historically. In order to design with equity as a goal, we first need to know the difference between equality and equity. The two words sound similar, but they're actually two different concepts. Equality means providing the same amount of opportunity and support to all segments of society. In other words, everyone gets the same thing. 

### Assistive Technology (AT)

Assistive Technology Overview
- AT includes a wide range of products and systems that improve learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities.
- Examples of AT range from high-tech devices like screen readers to low-tech solutions like pencil holders.

Types of Assistive Technologies
- Color modification enhances visibility for users with low vision, making interfaces easier to see.
- Voice control and switch devices assist users with limited dexterity, allowing them to navigate technology without traditional input methods.

Design Considerations for Accessibility
- Screen readers convert on-screen text to speech, aiding users with limited vision.
- Alternative text (alt text) describes images for those who cannot see them, providing context and improving user experience.

## Design Thinking

The design thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their problems are, and what your design should include.

The design thinking framework involves the following phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

**Understanding the Design Thinking Framework**  
- Frameworks guide UX designers in problem-solving and solution-building.  
- The design thinking framework is user-centered and iterative, involving five key phases.

**Phases of Design Thinking**  
- **Empathize:** Learn about users' needs and contexts through research methods like surveys and interviews.  
- **Define:** Analyze research to identify key user problems and create a clear problem statement.  
- **Ideate:** Generate a wide range of design solutions through collaborative brainstorming without judgment.  
- **Prototype and Test:** Develop early models of the product and test them iteratively to refine the design based on user feedback.

**Core Principles of UX Design**  
- Focus on user needs, collaborate across teams, validate designs, and iterate as necessary.

This framework will be explored further throughout the course, enhancing your UX design skills. 

Takeaway: Embrace the design thinking framework to create effective user-centered solutions in your UX design practice.

**Ideate Phase**
- Designers build on empathy research to define user problems.  
- The ideate phase encourages creativity and collaboration among team members.  

Brainstorming Techniques
- "How might we?" questions help reframe problems into opportunities.  
- Rapid Sketching (or "Crazy Eights") allows for quick visual ideation.  
- Competitive audits provide insights from competitors' strengths and weaknesses.  
- SCAMPER technique encourages exploring alternatives through substitution, combination, and modification.  

Collaboration and Business Requirements
- Effective ideation often involves collaboration with users and stakeholders.  
- Designers must ensure ideas align with business requirements and project constraints.  

Key Takeaway
The ideate phase is a judgment-free space for generating numerous ideas, which are later evaluated against business needs to find the best solutions.

**The Prototype Phase**
In the prototype phase, UX designers will create a model of the product. To do this, they’ll use various practices such as:

- Information architecture
- Sitemaps
- Wireframing (paper and digital)
- Lo-fi prototypes
- Hi-fi prototypes 

The goal of prototyping is to have a model to test and gain feedback on. The prototyping and testing phases of design thinking work in tandem.

**Testing**
Testing is the fifth phase of the design thinking process. And, as you’ve already learned, testing often happens in cycles with prototyping. 

In the test phase, the goal is to refine the prototype as designers gain insight into whether or not it solves the defined problem. Once the testing is done, the prototype will be finalized, and the prototype will move on to the developers, who will turn the design into the actual product.  

## Design Sprints

There are five phases of a design sprint, which is a structured process used in UX design to solve design challenges effectively.

### Design Sprint Phases

1. **Understand**: The team learns about the design challenge through discussions with experts and stakeholders, ensuring a user-centered approach.
2. **Ideate**: Participants brainstorm and sketch potential solutions, fostering creativity and planning for user testing.

Deciding and Prototyping Solutions
3. **Decide**: The team evaluates the ideas generated and selects the most promising solution to develop further.
4. **Prototype**: A working prototype of the chosen solution is created, focusing on user experience rather than a finished product.

Testing and Feedback
5. **Test**: The prototype is presented to users for testing, allowing the team to gather feedback and insights for improvements before the final launch. 

This structured approach helps teams effectively address design challenges and enhance user experience.

## UX Research

UX research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.

While research takes place throughout the product development lifecycle, there are different types of research that take place at different phases of product development. The research that happens before anything else is done is called **foundational research**, also sometimes called strategic, or generative research. 

Foundational research is used to answer the questions:

- What should be built?
- What are the user problems?
- How can they be solved?

The goal of foundational research is to help define the problem you would like to design a solution for. 

Research that takes place during the design phase, phase 3, of the product development life cycle, is called **design research**. 
Some teams call it tactical research, but both terms refer to the same thing. Design research answers the question, "How should we build it?" 

Here's a list of things you might want to ask users about during this phase of research. 

- How was your experience using the prototype today? 
- How easy or difficult was it to use? Why? 
- Did you encounter any challenges? 

The third type of user research is called **post-launch research**. Post-launch research answers the question, "Did we succeed?" The goal of post-launch research is to understand how users experienced the product and whether it was a good or poor user experience. 

Qualities of a good UX researcher include empathy, pragmatism, and collaboration.

The **product development life cycle** has five stages: 
- Brainstorm
- Define
- Design
- Test
- Launch
