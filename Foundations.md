# Foundations

## What is user experience

UX is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product. A **product** can be a *good*, a *service*, or a *feature*.

For a user to have a good experience, a product must be usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful.

Usability refers to clear and intuitive design e.g., icons have very obvious meanings or they have text with them.

Equitable design means a product that is accessible to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. It ensures a high-quality experience is delivered to all users regardless of background, gender, race, or ability. It improves the user's quality of life. As you evaluate the equity of a product’s UX, you can ask questions like: Are the needs of a diverse group of users considered? Does the product’s design address the needs of traditionally underrepresented and excluded groups? 

Enjoyable products create a connection between the user and the product. This involves research.

Useful, means a product that solves a problem for the user.

## Product Development Life Cycle

- Brainstorm
- Define
- Design
- Test
- Launch
The course content focuses on the product development lifecycle in UX design, outlining the stages involved in transforming an idea into a tangible product.

Brainstorm Stage
- This initial stage emphasizes generating ideas and understanding user needs and challenges.
- Research is crucial, involving methods like user interviews to gather insights.

Define Stage
- The team narrows down the focus based on insights from brainstorming, determining how the product will impact users.
- Specific details about the product's purpose, target audience, and necessary features are established.

Design Stage
- UX designers actively develop ideas and ensure that specifications from the define stage are realistic.
- Various design assets, such as storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes, are created to visualize the user experience.

Test Stage
- The product design is evaluated through user feedback, identifying areas for improvement.
- Collaboration between UX designers and engineers is essential to refine the design and ensure functionality.

Launch Stage
- The final stage involves sharing the product with the public, such as launching an app or website.
- Post-launch, there may still be opportunities for enhancements based on user feedback. 

Overall, the five stages are brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch, each playing a critical role in creating a successful user experience.
