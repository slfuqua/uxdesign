I am a master problem solver with eighteen years experience as a technical support professional. In 18 years, I've helped nearly 5,000 users with technical problems. I'm extensively certified with Microsoft Certified System Engineer (MCSE), Apple Certified Macintosh Technician (ACMT), CompTIA A+, Network+ and Server+ certifications. I have taught profesional courses for both A+ and Network+ certifications for aspiring technicians with Vermont Panurgy, and professional software courses such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and others, with both Panurgy and the University of Vermont.

I teach and provide technical support with empathy and patience.
