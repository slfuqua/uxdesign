## Research and Interviews

Empathy is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts in a situation. 

### Interview Tips

**Ask lots of questions.** As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.

**Become more observant.** Shift your focus to the whole user and not just the words they are using. In interviews where the user is physically present or on a video recording, watching a user interact with you or your product can provide physical cues that can affect your research outcomes. To help capture observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.

**Be an active listener.** Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs.

**Request input.** It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you. So, it’s important to request input from a variety of sources and a diverse group of users. When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.

**Have an open mind.** We all have biases. Remember, a bias is favoring or having prejudice against something or someone, based on limited information. As UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions. 

**Keep current on UX research.** Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience.

### Planning for Interviews

When planning for interviews, designers often:

1. Create research goals to guide the interview questions they ask and the design decisions they make based on users’ responses 

2. Determine the target audience for the product they’re designing for and list key characteristics of the users they want to interview

3. Write a list of interview questions so they can determine effective questions in advance and ensure consistency across interviews with different users

### Research Goals

Research goals guide the interview process and shape subsequent design decisions, so they need to be clear and focused on the problem the designers are trying to solve.

To craft such goals, effective designers often start by considering empathetic questions like these:

- Who are my users and what problems or needs is my product aiming to solve?

- What about my users do I want to learn from the interviews? 

- Are there certain user problems or pain points I need to learn more about?

These kinds of user-focused questions help designers connect with users and create effective research goals, such as:

- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.

- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.

- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.

In the example, notice how the designer defines interview goals that are both clear and specific to the Zia’s Pizza app:

    I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and when meal planning.

    I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of ordering from a restaurant.  

- Determine the target audience for the product they’re designing for and list key characteristics of the users they want to interview.

When recruiting and choosing participants to interview, effective designers aim for a representative sample of their target users. To get the best data, it’s important to include a group that’s manageable to interview while also being diverse enough to represent the product’s real-world audience. To define this kind of group, designers often start by considering questions like these:

    How might these characteristics shape users’ experiences with or feelings about my product or similar products?

For the Zia’s Pizza app, the ideal interview participants represent the app’s end users. They:

    Are aged 18–62

    Live in metropolitan or suburban areas

    Order food from restaurants at least once a week

    Include people of different genders 

    Include people with disabilities
`
- Write a list of interview questions so they can determine effective questions in advance and ensure consistency across interviews with different users.

Effective interview questions have five characteristics. They are: relevant, open-ended, clear, neutral, and designed for follow-up. Before you explore these characteristics in detail, consider the example interview questions again: 

    What is your current schedule like? How do you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?

    How often do you order meals from a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation? 

    What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How do these challenges make you feel? How do you think these challenges could be resolved?

These example questions are **relevant** because they align with the problem the designer is trying to solve. They are designed to gather information about the experiences, needs, or pain points that users may have with the product or with similar products. 

The example questions are **open-ended** in that they invite participants to share freely and elaborate. None can be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” Unless a designer needs a definitive “yes” or “no” answer to a particular question, open-ended questions will almost always generate richer and deeper information about users’ experiences.

The questions are also **neutral**, which means they are not designed to lead or pressure participants toward a desired response. For comparison, consider this leading, non-neutral question: “When you order meals from a restaurant, is it because you don’t have time to cook or because you don’t want to cook?” This question makes assumptions about users’ motivations and leads them into specific kinds of answers. In contrast, neutral questions will invite participants to share without assuming, anticipating, or directing their responses.

And notice how **short and simple** the questions are. They will be easy for interview participants to understand and answer because they are conversational and straightforward. 

Finally, notice how the questions are **designed for follow-up**. Questions 1–3 all have two parts. The interviewer might start with the first part and then prompt participants to elaborate with the second part. During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice.  Effective designers often follow up with simple prompts like“Tell me more about that” or with classic “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” questions. 

### Key takeaways

Research goals, participant characteristics, and interview questions are the foundation for conducting effective interviews, empathizing with users, and getting useful information about their needs, problems, and experiences.

### Recruiting Participants

**Screener Surveys**
A detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study.

Screening participants often requires collecting demographics, which are the characteristics of a group or individual. Demographics that you might ask about in a screener survey include:

- Age

- Geographic location 

- Job title or industry 

- Gender

Interviewing participants with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities is extremely important to ensure that your designs are accessible and equitable. As you start thinking about who you are designing for, aim to form a representative sample. A **representative sample** is a subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group.

**Mothods for Recruiting**
- Personal network, friends, coworkers, or family
- Existing user base
- Social media, usertesting.com, userinterviews.com
- Go out and ask people in person
- Third-part recruiting agencies

**Prepare for the interview**

- **Script interview questions**. Develop a list of questions that you’ll ask all of the users you interview. It's considered a best practice to keep interview questions fairly consistent across users, but this list of questions is just a guide. You can deviate from the questions you prepared, if necessary, to learn more about the user and their pain points.
- **Collect supplies.** Create a checklist of items you'll need for the interview, such as a computer, a printed list of questions, or paper and a pencil.
- **Research the users.** Take time to learn what you can about the people you’ll interview using sites like LinkedIn and social media.
- **Practice.** It’s always a good idea to practice delivering the questions you’ll ask users before you conduct a real interview. 
  
**Meet the participant**

- **Build raport.** Ask the participant about their day.
- **Thank them for coming.**
- **Ask your scripted questions to gather basic details.** Ask clear and concise questions, be an active listener, take notes.
- **Ask open-ended questions.**

**Note taking**

- **Highlight compelling quotes.**
- **Document observations about the participant**
- **Record interviews** if the participant agrees.
- **Thank the participant again at the end.**

**Empathizing**

One empathy exercise for designers to use their imaginations and perspective-taking skills to anticipate their users’ experiences, so they can ask better interview questions. 

**User profiles** are short biographies that describe fictional people who stand in for real-life interview participants. Don’t confuse user profiles with user personas: User profiles are short, fictional biographies that aid with informal empathy exercises. In contrast, user personas have a more formal role in the design process: After designers interview lots of people, they distill common user characteristics into user personas, who then stand in for larger groups of similar users throughout the design process.

### Empathy Maps

An **empathy map** is an easily understood chart that explains everything desighers have learned about a type of user. An empathy map has five sections:

1. What the user says
2. What the user thinks
3. What the user does
4. How the user feels
5. The user is in the center, touching each of the four areas

**Types of empathy maps**

It's important to understand that there are two types of empathy maps: **one-user empathy maps** and **aggregated empathy maps** (also known as "multiple-user empathy maps"). One-user empathy maps are created by taking the data from one user's interview and turning it into an empathy map, like the example earlier in this reading. This approach helps designers distill a single user's thoughts, feelings, and traits into a format that's easier to gather data from.

The other kind of empathy map, an aggregated empathy map, represents a group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions, or qualities. Aggregated empathy maps are created by creating multiple one-user empathy maps, then combining the maps where users expressed similar things into a new empathy map. This helps designers identify segments, or groups of people with similar tendencies, who will use the product. The insights in aggregated empathy maps allow designers to identify themes, which helps them better empathize with the groups they are designing for.

### Personas

**Personas** are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of people.

A **user group** is a set of people who have similar interestes, goals, or concerns.
