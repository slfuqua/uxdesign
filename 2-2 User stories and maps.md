## User Stories

A **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from the persona’s point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.

As a [type of user (who)], I want to [action (what)] so that [benefit (why)].

This who-what-why template helps designers craft compelling user stories that concisely express who users are, what they need, and why: 

- Who is the “type of user” the product is for.  
- What is the “action” the user hopes will happen.
- Why is the “benefit” the user wants to achieve from that action.

Like the user personas they’re based on, user stories help teams:

- Distill key user characteristics and needs into single characters and succinct stories
- Prioritize and unite around clear design goals based on user needs
- Take a user-centered approach and make empathetic design decisions
- Convince stakeholders by showing how design decisions will help specific types of people

When a user stays on the **happy path** in a user story, they reach their goal without any issues because everything goes as expected. **Edge cases** are uses of a product that were not intended, and therefore not planned for. 

Tips for keeping users on a happy path:
- Create personas and user stories to represent as diverse a representation of your uses as possible.
- Thoroughly review the project before launch.
- Use wireframes.

A **user journey** is the series of experiences a user has as they achive a specific goal. **User journey maps** are an illistration of what the user goes through to achieve their goals. The benefits of user journey maps are:
- Helping UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users.
- Reducing the impact of designer bias.
- Highlighting new or previously unknown pain points.
- Identifying opportunites for improvements.

To create journey map for a persona, create a grid with four rows: Action, Task list, Feeling adjectives, Improvement opportunities.

- **Action** is a list of steps the user will take to reach their goal successfully. 
- **Task list** is a list of actual steps involved for that particular action. 
- **Feeling adjectives** are how the user is feeling while taking that action.
- **Improvement opportunities** are steps the developer can take to improve the user experience while completing the tasks.

## Accessibility

Accessifility is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities. Instead, it extends to anyone who is experiencing a permanent, temporary, or situational disability.

### Touch

How would you design for users who have use of one arm, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?
- Decide where to place buttons within your design based on several different hand sizes.
  
- Create a feature that allows double taps to avoid accidental icon clicks.

- Enable the one-handed keyboard feature and general keyboard compatibility.

- Allow button customization for easy access to information that the user finds most important.

### Vision

How would you design for users who have limited vision, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?

- Use a larger font to create a reader-friendly design of the app.

- Ensure the app and the images have alternate text that can be read by a screen reader.

- Detect whether the user is operating a motor vehicle.

- Design the app with high contrast colors.

- Don’t rely on text color to explain navigation or next steps. For example, don’t use red text alone as an indicator of a warning. Instead, your design should include explicit instructions.

**customizable text** is a feature that allows users to change how text is displayed in order to read the text more easily.  Text customization involves changing everything from the color or font to the size or even the spacing of the text. For example, some fonts may be easier for users to read , so customizing fonts could be a great help. Therefore, customizable text allows more options than simply magnifying the text or zooming in, making the content more adaptable yet maintaining the functionality. 

### Hearing

How would you design for users who have limited hearing, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 

- Don’t rely solely on sounds to provide app updates, like a new message notification. Instead, enable haptics, which are vibrations that engage a user’s sense of touch, and notification lights.

- Apply closed captioning to all videos. 

- Provide a text messaging system within the app to allow users to communicate through writing.

### Speaking

How would you design for users who cannot speak, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 

- Provide written intros, descriptions, and instructions for users, in addition to video-based content.

- Provide Real-Time Texting during phone calls with users or with app support.

- Arrange alternatives for automated systems that rely on speech recognition.

- Provide an in-app messaging system that allows the use of emojis and image uploads.

This list is just a small fraction of the considerations you should take into account when designing for users with disabilities. The best way to learn about how to improve your designs is to conduct research and get feedback from people with disabilities directly.

### Learning Disabilities

How would you design for neurodiverse users, such as those with Dyslexia or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? 

- Avoid complexity. Keep your designs and navigation as simple, concise, and straightforward as possible. 

- Make navigation consistent across your entire website or mobile design.

- Use familiar and widely accepted icons and symbols.

- Consider pairing text with graphics, images, or even video or audio explanations.
