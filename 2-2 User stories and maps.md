A **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from the persona’s point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.

As a [type of user (who)], I want to [action (what)] so that [benefit (why)].

Like the user personas they’re based on, user stories help teams:

- Distill key user characteristics and needs into single characters and succinct stories
- Prioritize and unite around clear design goals based on user needs
- Take a user-centered approach and make empathetic design decisions
- Convince stakeholders by showing how design decisions will help specific types of people
